### Prior Research Experiences

1. Computational Uncertainty Lab:
- Generate 1-4 week ahead forecasts using a novel, cluster-based Bayesian SEIR model, motivated by the difference in seasonal trajectories of incident cases of influenza in Pennsylvania after the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared
to a traditional SEIR model, a model that first partitions S seasons into K clusters and then trains an SEIR model on each cluster will produce a more accurate and calibrated forecast.
- During flu season, train the model weekly on incident influenza cases from 2009 until present at the county level (N=67 counties) in Pennsylvania. This work involves data formatting, preparation, and analysis in Python3.
- Communicate results weekly to the Pennsylvania Department of Health to support mitigation strategies.
2. Lehigh University Honors Capstone Project:
- Created a tutorial demonstrating using R and Stan to implement Bayesian spatial filtering (BSF) for areal data
which improves upon traditional hierarchical models by using a basis expansion for the spatial random effects.
- Tutorial was created utilizing RMarkdown and LaTeX.
- Link to tutorial: https://hkeetley.github.io/BSFTutorial/
3. Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center:
- Analyzed the prevalence of oncologists receiving pharmaceutical payments for competing drugs by processing and synthesizing large government datasets (~60,000 rows) in R, the results of which were used to draw conclusions on the impact of health policy on treatment outcomes.
- Wrote and prepared a scientific manuscript for publication.
4. Department of Biostatistics, The Mayo Clinic:
- Analyzed the effectiveness of a preoperative clinic in reducing addiction. The hypothesis for this work was that patients who attended this clinic prior to surgery would have lower levels of addiction 1 year post surgery.
- Models and analysis were trained on a dataset that included self-reported addiction status 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-surgery. Analysis methods included propensity score matching, missing data analysis techniques, time series analysis, and logistic regression.
- Data cleaning, missing data analysis, data analysis, and data visualization were performed using R and SAS.
