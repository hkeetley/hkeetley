### Prior Research Experiences

1. Computational Uncertainty Lab:
- Generate 1-4 week ahead forecasts using a novel, cluster-based Bayesian SEIR model, motivated by the difference in seasonal trajectories of incident cases of influenza in Pennsylvania after the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared
to a traditional SEIR model, a model that first partitions S seasons into K clusters and then trains an SEIR model on each cluster will produce a more accurate and calibrated forecast.
- During flu season, train the model weekly on incident influenza cases from 2009 until present at the county level (N=67 counties) in Pennsylvania. This work involves data formatting, preparation, and analysis in Python3.
- Communicate results weekly to the Pennsylvania Department of Health to support mitigation strategies.
2. Lehigh University Honors Capstone Project:
- Created a tutorial demonstrating using R and Stan to implement Bayesian spatial filtering (BSF) for areal data
which improves upon traditional hierarchical models by using a basis expansion for the spatial random effects.
- Tutorial was created utilizing RMarkdown and LaTeX.
